I am a postdoc at the [Statistical Materials Modeling](http://www.smmlab.it/) group, at the [Department of Physics](http://www.fisica.unimi.it/ecm/home) of the [University of Milano](https://www.unimi.it/it), and a memeber of the [Center for Complexity and Biosystems](https://complexitybiosystems.it/en/home), and interdisciplinary institution that brings together Physics & Materials, Biosystems and Computer Science.

I am also CRO at [ComplexData SRL](https://www.complexdata.it/), a spin-off of the CC&B that has been awarded several [prizes](https://www.complexdata.it/) and launched [ARIADNE](https://ariadneweb.it/), a platform that uses artificial intelligence for risk prediction in breast cancer.
