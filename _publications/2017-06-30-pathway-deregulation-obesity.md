Abstract: Obesity is a pandemic disease, linked to the onset of type 2 diabetes and cancer. Transcriptomic data provides a picture of the alterations in regulatory and metabolic activities associated with obesity, but its interpretation is typically blurred by noise. Here, we solve this problem by collecting publicly available transcriptomic data from adipocytes and removing batch effects using singular value decomposition. In this way we obtain a gene expression signature of 38 genes associated to obesity and identify the main pathways involved. We then show that similar deregulation patterns can be detected in peripheral markers, in type 2 diabetes and in breast cancer. The integration of different data sets combined with the study of pathway deregulation allows us to obtain a more complete picture of gene-expression patterns associated with obesity, breast cancer, and diabetes.
