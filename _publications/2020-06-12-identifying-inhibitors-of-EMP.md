Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of various regulatory networks implicated in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Plasticity (EMP) through  two different mathematical modelling frameworks: a discrete, parameter-independent framework (Boolean) and a continuous, parameter-agnostic modelling framework (RACIPE). Results from either framework in terms of phenotypic distributions obtained from a given EMP network are qualitatively similar and suggest that these networks are multi-stable and can give rise to phenotypic plasticity.
