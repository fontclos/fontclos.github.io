Abstract: The  transition  between  epithelial  and  mesenchymal  states  hasfundamental  importance  for  embryonic  development,  stem  cellreprogramming,  and  cancer  progression.  Here,  we  construct  atopographic map underlying epithelial–mesenchymal transitionsusing a combination of numerical simulations of a Boolean net-work model and the analysis of bulk and single-cell gene expres-sion  data.  The  map  reveals  a  multitude  of  metastable  hybridphenotypic states, separating stable epithelial and mesenchymalstates, and is reminiscent of the free energy measured in glassymaterials and disordered solids. Our work not only elucidates thenature of hybrid mesenchymal/epithelial states but also providesa general strategy to construct a topographic representation ofphenotypic plasticity from gene expression data using statisticalphysics methods.
