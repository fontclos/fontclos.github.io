Abstract: The distribution patterns of cancer metastasis depend on a sequence of steps involving adhesion molecules and on mechanical and geometrical effects related to blood circulation, but how much each of these two aspects contributes to the metastatic spread of a specific tumor is still unknown. Here we address this question by simulating cancer cell trajectories in a high-resolution humanoid model of global blood circulation, including stochastic adhesion events, and comparing the results with the location of metastasis recorded in thousands of human autopsies for seven different solid tumors, including lung, prostate, pancreatic and colorectal cancers, showing that on average 40% of the variation in the metastatic distribution can be attributed to blood circulation. Our humanoid model of circulating tumor cells allows us to predict the metastatic spread in specific realistic conditions and can therefore guide precise therapeutic interventions to fight metastasis.
